== VoxelClock ==

A common issue when working with a large community from all over the world
is time zones. Members need to estimate and do more work then needed for
collaborative development. Thus, we created VoxelTime. Time that is relative to
the current server you're playing on, which is the same across the entire
world, no matter what location.

Currently the plugin was just created to implemenet the solution, but
more awesome features are being planned to give even better & useful
features for time. 

Anyone interested in helping with the upcoming development is more then
welcome to contact '''thedeadlybutter'''.
